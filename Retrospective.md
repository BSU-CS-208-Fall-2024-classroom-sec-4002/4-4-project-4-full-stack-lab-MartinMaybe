## Experience

I have completed Project 4. This project was pretty simple at the start, as styling and organizing is pretty easy and fun. The database stuff was just unfamiliar and I struggled to understand it. I don’t even know if I did it right or if it’s working properly. I began with adjusting the pug file. I did it all in html and then used the linked website to convert it. It became easier to understand as I saw it being converted. It’s very similar with small changes like no closing tags and different syntax. It makes me wonder why it is better or why use it as an alternative for the most part, but I can also recognize it’s uses. 

I made a barebones template of the pug and took to the CSS to make my app look a lot prettier. I changed the headers and texts to look more appealing. Then, I added spacings and padding to the texts and elements. It was a mixture of changing position adjusting values to make not look horrid. Then, I changed the colors and messed around with them. I used a website that gave me gradients for certain shades and it was fun to mess with. 

The database is where I ran into problems. I simply copied the example code we were given for the most part. I did minor adjustments to make sure they worked together, but I don’t see changes or know if it worked properly. I take it as a win as my program didn’t crash and die on me. It’s new to me so I definitely struggled to understand it.
